## Google Sheets Logging

Run ./configurePins.sh to set up the pins for i2c, then run ./tempatureAlerts.py to start the logging. 

The code will log to this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ggW83WNoR0cbjVklPcgcfQbznsnnmuyi9GPFUNQnAJw/edit#gid=0) where there is also a graph of the temperature. The few spikes up to 80 degrees and over is when I had my finger on the temperature sensor. The temperature seemed to level off around 73.4 for room temperature.


## Project Milestones
I think our project has 4 big milestones to hit: acquiring the new image to use a monitor with the beaglebone, setting up the webpage for the proper display, finishing the actual code, and building the mirror itself. The last two milestones can be done in parallel, but the first one is definitely needed in order to get started on the others.

I think we can outline it as so:

- Install new image (Due by 11/5)
- Setup initial state for a webpage layout (Due 11/8)
- Button up back end code for mirror (Due 11/15)
- Finish mirror assembly and make it look pretty (Due 11/18)
