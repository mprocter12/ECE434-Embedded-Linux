##Google Sheets Logging

Run ./configurePins.sh to set up the pins for i2c, then run ./tempatureAlerts.py to start the logging. The code will log to this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ggW83WNoR0cbjVklPcgcfQbznsnnmuyi9GPFUNQnAJw/edit#gid=0) where there is also a graph of the temperature. The few spikes up to 80 degrees and over is when I had my finger on the temperature sensor. The temperature seemed to level off around 73.4 for room temperature.
